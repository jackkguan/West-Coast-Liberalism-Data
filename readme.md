# The Electoral Crisis of 'West Coast Liberalism" Data
This repository hosts the data and replication code for various parts of my Political Science honors thesis entitled "The Crisis of "West Coast Liberalism". I completed the project at UC Berkeley in the Travers Department of Political Science's honors program. I was advised by Professor David Broockman and Professor Terri Bimes. My research was supported by the Fiat Lux Fellowship,the Charles H. Percy Undergraduate Grant for Public Affairs Research, and the Student Opportunity Fund.
